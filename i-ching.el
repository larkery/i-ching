;;; Commentary:

;; The I Ching or Book of Changes can be used as a divination method,
;; pattern generator or fixed point for millennia of commentary & exegesis.
;;
;; This package provides methods for casting and describing hexagrams,
;; querying the oracle, and finding patterns in randomness.
;;
;; The descriptions of hexagrams and their classification have been drawn from
;; public domain sources, tradition and antiquity. Further details of usage
;; along with reading & study material can be found in the README file.

;; - [...]
;; - transliteration to emacs on Lunar New Year, Metal Snake
